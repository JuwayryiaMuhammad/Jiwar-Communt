 * The audit catalog is covered by two suites, one scenario per entry:
 * - test/community/audit-coverage.e2e-spec.ts covers the entries listed here
 *   (Phase 2 community actions);
 * - test/audit/audit-coverage.e2e-spec.ts covers every other entry.
 * Each suite fails when one of its entries has no scenario, and this list may
 * only name real catalog entries, so nothing can fall between the two.
